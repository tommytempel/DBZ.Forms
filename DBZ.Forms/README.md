I have added Flex to the mainpage of my DBZ Charecters and their forms. I will go in to each charecter page and modify as needed with Flex. As I continue to learn js I will try and incorporate it into this project. 
	1. Made changes to individual charecters. I still have some work to do on Goku's page. Master Roshi and Broly have been edited using Flex. I expect I will revisit them to add js language.
