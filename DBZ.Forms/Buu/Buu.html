            <H3>Majin Buu</H3>
            <p1>This is the first form we see Majin Buu in. You can blame
                <a href="../Goku/Goku.html">Goku</a> and <a href="../Vegeta/Vegeta.html">Vegeta</a>
                for him appearing. But he's a good guy now so please thank them.

                <h3>Fit Buu</h3>
                <p1>This is Majn Buu when he trains. Unfortently, he fell asleep before
                    the Tournament of Power so we did not get a chance to see it in action.

            <div class="text">
                <ul><img class="img" href="../images/evilbuu.jpg"></ul>
                <h3>Evil Buu</h3>
                <p1>This is Buu's Evil Energy that was released when the dog was
                    shot. (The dog was healed.)

                <h3>Super Buu</h3>
                <p1>This was the form Evil Buu took after absorbing Majin Buu.

                <h3>Kid Buu</h3>
                <p1>This is the original form of Majin Buu. He was later reincarnated
                    as a Human named Uub per <a href="../Goku/Goku.html">Goku's</a> request.
