                     Frieza First Form. 
                  </li>
                  <p class="friezatext">This was the form Frieza was introduced with. This is how he tended to conceal his power as his full power made him more violent. Overtime he opted to remain in his final form as this became obsolete.</p>

                     Frieza's Second Form
                  </li>
                  <p class="friezatext">This is Frieza's Second Form. We first see him transform after finding Krillin, Gohan, Vegeta and Dende with the now useless Dragon Balls. Vegeta Eggs him on and wants Frieza to transform. Not Vegeta's brightest request.</p>

                  <p class="friezatext">This is Frieza's Third form. It was only shown briefly as Frieza must have really felt like showing off.</p>
