                     Frieza First Form. 
                  </li>
                  <p class="friezatext">This was the form Frieza was introduced with. This is how he tended to conceal his power as his full power made him more violent. Overtime he opted to remain in his final form as this became obsolete.</p>

                     <img src="../images/Frieza2nd.jpg">
                     Frieza's Second Form
                  </li>
                  <p class="friezatext">This is Frieza's Second Form. We first see him transform after finding Krillin, Gohan, Vegeta and Dende with the now useless Dragon Balls. Vegeta Eggs him on and wants Frieza to transform. Not Vegeta's brightest request.</p>

                     Frieza's Third Form 
                  </li>
                  <p class="friezatext">This is Frieza's Third form. It was only shown briefly as Frieza must have really felt like showing off.</p>
                  <li>
                     <img src="../images/4thFrieza.jpg">
                     Frieza's Fourth Form
                  </li>
                  <p class="friezatext">This is Frieza's base form. He used to use the prior forms as his real power
                     was difficult to control.
                  </p>

                  </li>
                  <p1 class="friezatext">This is Frieza's Golden form. He obtained this after training for four months 
                     when he was brought back to life. He planned to use it to kill <a href="../Goku/Goku.html">Goku.</a>

                  </li>
                  <p1 class="friezatext">Frieza's Newest form. We were left with a cliffhanger on this one but he whooped 
                     <a href="../Goku/Goku.html">Goku</a> and <a href="../Vegeta/Vegeta.html">Vegeta's</a> ass.
